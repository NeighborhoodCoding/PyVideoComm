![Python Video Comm image](example.gif "Python Video Comm on the PC")

PyVideoComm is basic start code that makes sending and receiving video in two programs very easy by Python.

## Overview
PyVideoComm consists of two files: 
PyVideoComm_sender.py and PyVideoComm_receiver.py.

Each file corresponds to a transmitter/receiver and provides a basic file selection/saving UI. 
The transmitter allows you to select files to send with a UI.
And the receiver allows you to save files to receive with a UI.

## Additional features
(1) PyVideoComm_sender.py has a stop sending button, so you can stop the video transmission midway.
(2) PyVideoComm_sender.py and PyVideoComm_receiver.py can send/receive repeatedly.
(3) PyVideoComm_receiver.py has a function to display the received video in real time.

## Create your own executables.
You may use some Pyinstaller or etc to create executable exe files for the video sender and video receiver.
